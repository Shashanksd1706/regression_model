🚀 Project Showcase: Software Developer Salary Prediction App
I'm excited to share my latest data science project: a web application that predicts software developer salaries based on country, education level, and years of experience!
🛠️ Project Overview
I built a full-stack data application using Python and Streamlit that allows users to:

Predict their potential salary based on their profile
Explore salary trends across different countries
Visualize how experience impacts compensation
Compare education levels and their effect on earnings

💻 Technical Implementation

Data Processing: Implemented comprehensive data cleaning with pandas, including handling nulls, standardizing education categories, and normalizing experience values
Machine Learning: Built a regression model using scikit-learn to predict salaries based on multiple features
Feature Engineering: Applied label encoding for categorical variables (country and education)
Data Visualization: Created interactive charts with Matplotlib to display salary trends
Web Application: Developed a user-friendly interface with Streamlit featuring both prediction and exploration pages

📊 Key Features

Interactive slider for selecting years of experience
Country and education level selection via dropdown menus
Data visualizations including pie charts for data distribution
Bar charts showing salary variations by country
Line charts demonstrating the relationship between experience and compensation

🔍 What I Learned
This project strengthened my skills in the complete data science workflow - from data preprocessing and model building to deployment and visualization. It reinforced the importance of creating intuitive user interfaces that make ML models accessible to non-technical users.
